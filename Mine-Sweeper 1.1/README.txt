# Mine-Sweeper
---WHAT'S NEW---
1. Texture upgrade
2. Game developed in openGL instead of SDL2
3. Removed the sound when clicking
4. Game should run faster

------DEPENDENCIES-------
Here are all the dependencies you will need to compile this game:
    GL dev library (alteast 1.2)
    GLEW dev library (atleast 2.2)
    SDL2 dev library (atleast 2.0)
    GNU Compiler Collection (gcc)
    make

------COMPILING------
Compiling is really straight forward. First go into the games directory:
    cd path/to/game/directory
Once inside enter the command below to allow autogen.sh to run as a program. In some cases you'll need to run the command as root:
    chmod +x autogen.sh
After that run the autogen.sh file:
    ./autogen.sh
If the autogen.sh file completed successfully then you can run the makefile:
    make

That's it ! Now run the Mine_Sweeper executable and enjoy !
